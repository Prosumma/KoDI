# KoDI

KoDI is a tiny dependency injection library written in Kotlin. (It's also not the first Kotlin DI library to be called "KoDI".) 

It's primarily intended as an exercise in learning Kotlin. (I have no plans to promote its use.) Its goals are to be very simple, extensible, and pleasant to use.

The unit tests and source documentation will tell you most of what you need to know about using it.
